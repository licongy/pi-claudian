"@pi-claudian/auto-save-to-markdown": patch
---

Repair newline-fragmented thinking blocks when saving. Some upstream reasoning streams (observed with z-ai/GLM via OpenRouter) store thinking as one word — or one CJK character — per line, with the original spaces surviving only as leading spaces of the fragments; the exported markdown then rendered every token on its own line, which was unreadable and bloated the archive. The extension now detects such blocks (single-leading-space fragment lines, or a majority of 1–2-character fragment lines) and re-joins them into flowing text. Clean thinking blocks are written unchanged.
